python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
* Windows
```
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

#### Installing Python Dependencies
After activating the virtual environment, install the required Python dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

You will also need to run this command to download the embeddings:
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md 
```

### Executing program
* To run the program, execute the main.py script:
```
python main.py
